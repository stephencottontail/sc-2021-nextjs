# Ulysses
I created this note with another Siri Shortcut and edited it in Ulysses. I like Ulysses in this particular case because it can use the iPadOS edit-in-place feature so I don’t have to manually export to the `posts` folder whenever I edit a note.

## Typography
Actually, I don’t really need to test typography features again. So I won’t.
