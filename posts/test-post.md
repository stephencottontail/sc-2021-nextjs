# Test Post
This post was created via a Siri Shortcut. Well, the front matter and the post title were; the rest of the post was created by typing.

## Typography
Here’s some *bold text*, some /italicized text/, and some _underlined text_. Here’s a [link to another site](https://www.apple.com/).

Like all great JavaScript developers, I use `console.log()` for debugging. I also use tabs (four spaces) for indentation:

```
function() {
	console.log( ‘foo’ );
}
```

(A funny story, though; Bear apparently displays the tab character with two spaces and I couldn’t figure out a way to change that.)
